# Doubly-LinkedLists

we define a linked list in which each node keeps
an explicit reference to the node before it and a reference to the node after it. Such
a structure is known as a doubly linked list.
These lists allow a greater variety of O(1)-time update operations,
including insertions and deletions at arbitrary positions
within the list. We continue to use the term “next” for the reference to thenode that follows another,and we introduce the term “prev” for the reference to the node that precedes it.
